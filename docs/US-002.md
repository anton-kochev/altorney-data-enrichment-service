# US-002: Product ID to Name Mapping

## Story Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | MANDATORY (P0) |
| **Epic** | Core Data Enrichment Engine |
| **Complexity** | S |
| **Dependencies** | US-001 |

## User Story

As an **API consumer**, I want the service to translate productId values to productName values in my trade data so that I can work with human-readable product information.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. For each trade row, the service looks up the productId in the product reference data
2. When a match is found, productName is added to the output row
3. The productId field is replaced with productName in the output
4. Lookup operation is O(1) or O(log n) complexity
5. Mapping is thread-safe when handling concurrent requests

## Technical Notes

- Use `ConcurrentDictionary<int, string>` or `ImmutableDictionary<int, string>` for thread-safety
- Consider using `TryGetValue()` for safe lookups
