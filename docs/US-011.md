## User Story

As a system administrator, I want a health check endpoint so that I can monitor service availability and readiness.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

| # | Criteria | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Endpoint is available at GET /health | Done |
| 2 | Returns HTTP 200 when service is healthy | Done |
| 3 | Returns HTTP 503 when service is unhealthy | Done |
| 4 | Response includes Status (Healthy/Unhealthy) | Done |
| 5 | Response includes Product data loaded status | Done |
| 6 | Response includes Timestamp | Done |
| 7 | Does not require authentication | Done |

## Technical Notes

- Use ASP.NET Core controller-based approach
- Check `IProductLookupService.IsLoaded` for health status
- Use source-generated logging with `[LoggerMessage]` attribute
