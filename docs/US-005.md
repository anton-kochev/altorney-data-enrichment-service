## User Story

As a system, I want to validate that date fields are in yyyyMMdd format so that I can ensure data quality and discard invalid records.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Date field must match exactly yyyyMMdd format (e.g., 20250605)
2. Date must represent a valid calendar date (e.g., not 20250231)
3. Invalid date formats result in the entire row being discarded from output
4. Each invalid date is logged with error level, including the row data and reason
5. Validation occurs before enrichment processing
6. Service tracks count of discarded rows due to date validation failures
