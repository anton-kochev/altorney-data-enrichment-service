# US-001: Load Product Reference Data

## Story Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|------|
| **Priority** | MANDATORY (P0) |
| **Epic** | Core Data Enrichment Engine |
| **Complexity** | S |
| **Dependencies** | None |

## User Story

As a **system**, I want to load product reference data from a CSV file at startup so that I can efficiently map product IDs to product names during enrichment operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Service loads product.csv file from a configurable file path on startup
2. Product data is parsed and stored in an in-memory data structure (Dictionary/HashMap for O(1) lookup)
3. If product.csv is missing or unreadable, service logs an error and fails to start
4. If product.csv has invalid format, service logs specific parsing errors
5. Product data includes both productId (as key) and productName (as value)
6. Loading completes before the API becomes available to handle requests

## Technical Notes

- Use CsvHelper or similar library for CSV parsing
- Consider using `IOptions<ProductDataConfiguration>` for file path configuration
- Implement as a hosted service or startup initialization
