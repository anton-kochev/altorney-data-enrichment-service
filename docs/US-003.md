# US-003: Handle Missing Product Mappings

**Priority**: MANDATORY (P0)
**Epic**: Core Data Enrichment Engine
**Complexity**: S
**Dependencies**: US-002

## User Story

As an API consumer, I want trades with unmapped product IDs to still be included in the output with a placeholder product name so that I don't lose trade data due to missing reference information.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When a productId is not found in the product reference data, set productName to "Missing Product Name"
2. Log a warning message including the missing productId and the trade row data
3. The trade row is included in the output (not discarded)
4. Warning log includes timestamp and is aggregated if same productId appears multiple times
5. A count of missing mappings can be retrieved for reporting

## Technical Notes

- Use structured logging to enable querying for missing productIds
- Consider maintaining a set of logged missing IDs to avoid duplicate warnings
