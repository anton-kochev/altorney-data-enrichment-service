# US-004: Preserve Other Trade Data Fields

**Priority**: MANDATORY (P0)
**Epic**: Core Data Enrichment Engine
**Complexity**: XS
**Dependencies**: US-002
**Status**: Complete

## User Story

As an API consumer, I want all other fields from my trade data (date, currency, price) to remain unchanged in the enriched output so that I retain the complete trade information.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Date field is preserved in output (subject to validation - see US-005)
2. Currency field is preserved in output (with leading/trailing whitespace trimmed for data quality)
3. Price field is preserved exactly as provided in input
4. Field order in output matches expected format: date, productName, currency, price
5. No data transformation occurs on these fields beyond validation and whitespace trimming
