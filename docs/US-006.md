# US-006: Validate Required Fields

## Story Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | MANDATORY (P0) |
| **Epic** | Data Validation & Quality Control |
| **Complexity** | S |
| **Dependencies** | None |

## User Story

As a system, I want to validate that all required fields are present and non-empty so that I can process only complete trade records.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All fields (date, productId, currency, price) must be present in each row
2. No field can be null or empty string
3. Rows with missing fields are discarded and logged as errors
4. Error log includes which field(s) were missing
5. Service tracks count of rows discarded due to missing fields

## Technical Notes

- Implement early in the processing pipeline
- Consider using FluentValidation library for clean validation logic
